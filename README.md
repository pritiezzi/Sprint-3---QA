# Sprint-3---QA
API Testing

This project was all about testing the API for the app Urban Grocers.
•I started by studying the requirements as well as the API documentation in apiDoc and Swagger for the features to be tested. 
•I designed tests in a checklist form for all of the features to be tested based on the information outlined in the requirements. 
•I used Postman to run tests on the API, and Jira to create detailed bug reports linked to the testing checklist.
